        "\n",
        "AIWP models are weather models that have been trained to identify relationships between the state of the atmosphere at time t=0 and the state of the atmosphere at time t+1 using historical data like ECMWF's Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). The model can then be combined with any initial atmospheric state to predict a future state. For example, the model can use the atmospheric state at 00 UTC on Jan 1, 2025 to make a weather prediction for 06 UTC on Jan 1, 2025. It then takes its prediction for 06 UTC on Jan 1, 2025 as the input to predict the state at 12 UTC on Jan 1, 2025, and so on until the desired forecast length is reached (usually 10 days). This iterative process is referred to as an autoregressive model."

        "Numerical Weather Prediction models use partial differential equations that represent our physical understanding of the atmosphere - things like conservation of momentum, conservation of energy, etc. AIWP models don't need any of this information because, in a way, they can learn these sorts of relationships from the historical data. NWP models are very computationally expensive and take a long time to run, even on supercomputers. Meanwhile, you can run an AIWP model in minutes right here!"

        "\n",
        "State of the art AIWP models have been shown to have performance comparable to or better than NWP models in many regards. For example, in this chart from WeatherBench2, blue squares indicate variables where the AIWP model outperforms the IFS HRES NWP model (a state of the art NWP model) in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE). The Pangu-Weather and GraphCast squares are almost all blue!\n",

        "Results have been very exciting for the meteorological community. That said, there are some caveats - perhaps the the biggest one is that which model is \"better\" can be subjective. Just because one model has lower RMSE than another doesn't mean it's necessarily better for your use case. For example, a couple of commonly cited limitations for AIWP models is that they may struggle to predict extreme events like strong hurricanes or intense precipitation and that they tend to produce \"blurry\" looking output for longer range forecasts. Furthermore, one model may perform better than another in particular regions or for specific types of weather events. More research is being done to identify specific strengths and weaknesses of different models."

        "1.   AIWP models still fundamentally rely on NOAA's data assimilation processes. Data assimilation is the process through which weather observations across the globe are combined to create a \"best-guess\" at the current state of the atmosphere. The output of the data assimilation system is what is then used to initialize AIWP models.\n",
        "2.   Most AIWP models are limited in spatial resolution to 0.25° (~30km) because they are trained on ERA5 data, which itself has a resolution of 0.25°. 0.25° models are unable to capture many smaller, impactful meteorological features like thunderstorms. Traditional NWP models like the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh have spatial resolution of 3km and are much more capable of resolving smaller scale features.\n",
        "3.   AIWP models predict a limited subset of meteorological variables. For example, variables related to precipitation type, wind gusts, and cloud parameters are currently not predicted by any AIWP models.\n",
        "4.   There are still lingering questions about how well AIWP models can represent extreme weather events like hurricanes, intense precipitation, cold snaps, heat waves, etc.\n",
        "5.   NOAA is taking an active role in AIWP model research and exploring how to incorporate AIWP into operations to make weather forecasts more accurate.\n",
        "6.   The human factor: more accurate models are only one part of the equation. How the output of these models is then communicated to the general public is where NOAA really shines."
